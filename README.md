## Customer Churn Analysis
Customer churn analysis is a crucial process that involves evaluating customer retention levels to pinpoint areas for improvement. This analysis is instrumental for businesses aiming to enhance customer loyalty and optimize their Return on Investment (ROI).
### Data Overview
Our dataset comprises 10,000 customers, with 20.38% (2038 customers) experiencing churn. The average age of bank customers is 39.
### Identifying Characteristics of Churned Customers
1. Churn Rate by Age  
Dividing customer age into bins for easier analysis, we observed the highest churn rate (56.2%) in the age range of 50-60, out of 797 customers. Customers aged 36-50 also showed a significant churn rate of 24.69%.


2. Churn Rate by Tenure  
Customers with less than one year of banking experience exhibited the highest churn rate (23%), affecting 413 customers. Meanwhile, those with a banking history of 7 years demonstrated the lowest churn rate at 17.2%.

3. Churn Rate by Card Type  
Analyzing the relationship between card type and churn rate across tenures, we found that churn rates were distributed across all card types, indicating no specific correlation.

4. Churn Rate by Points Earned  
Exploring the impact of points earned on churn rate, customers accumulating 800-850 points had the highest churn rate. Interestingly, those with 850-900 points had the lowest churn rate.

5. Churn Rate by Satisfaction Score  
Despite expectations, our analysis did not reveal a correlation between satisfaction scores and churn rate. This suggests that either customers did not express their satisfaction accurately or churn reasons extend beyond service satisfaction.

6. Churn Rate by Country  
Germany had the highest churn rate at 32.44%, while France and Spain had churn rates of 16.17% and 16.67%, respectively.

7. Churn Rate by Active Members and Complaints  
Active members who experienced churn often had initial complaints. Detecting these issues earlier through customer churn analysis could have prevented customer loss.

## Recommendations  
1. Targeted Customer Engagement:  
Implement targeted engagement strategies for customers in the age range of 50-60 and 36-50, addressing their specific needs and concerns to reduce churn.  
2. Enhance Onboarding Experience:  
Focus on improving the onboarding experience for customers within their first year of banking, ensuring a seamless and satisfactory introduction to the bank's services.
3. Tailored Loyalty Programs:  
Tailor loyalty programs to incentivize customer activities that lead to higher points, with particular attention to customers earning between 800-850 points, aiming to decrease churn.
4. Feedback-Driven Satisfaction Improvements:
Collect detailed feedback from customers to identify specific aspects affecting satisfaction scores. Use this information to enhance services and address any dissatisfaction.
5. Geo-Specific Retention Strategies:
Implement targeted retention strategies in Germany, where the churn rate is highest. Understand and address the unique factors contributing to churn in this region to improve customer retention.
